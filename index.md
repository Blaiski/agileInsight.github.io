# Welcome to AgileInsight Profile Page

AgileInsight is a vscode extension created as part of my doctoral research. As user, it offers you the following:
### Artefact Traceability Benefits:
- Integrates your agile dashboard such as Jira or Trello into your vscode development envrionment
- Allows to inspect, read, comment on, and do all the common actions on your cards right within vscode
- Allows you to tag your source code items (e.g., methods, or files) to the specific issues or user stories that you are working on
- Once tagged, your source code items become tightly linked to the design items (i.e., issues, bugs, etc) that relates to them
- You can point to a card or issue to readily see all the code items related, and vice versa
### Software Visualisation Benefits:
- AgileInsight can visualise your source code using a state of the art visualisation technique called city metahpor (or software map) visualisation^*. 
- It visualisation cleverly brings out your source code structure allowing you to visually see the building blocks that make up your system--from folder or packages, down to files and individual methods inside.
- No matter what programming or scripting language your source code is, as long as your vscode editor can read it then AgileInsight should be able visualise it
- The visualisation
- * This is based on heirarchical treemap containment [#Ref CodeCity, SoftwareMap, and that old original work]
- 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
